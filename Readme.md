Really basic WordPress plugin that adds new fields to WooCommerce products and then displays that data underneath the listed products.

I built this for a client that wanted the product specs to show without having to click on the actual product. 

I plan on turning this into a more useful plugin that has an admin interface that would allow the user to add their own specific product specs and then choose where they display.

For now, you can at least use the logic to display those specs underneath images. This also uses custom taxonomies that are from another plugin, but you can ignore that part if you need to.
